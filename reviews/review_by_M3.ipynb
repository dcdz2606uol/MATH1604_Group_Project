Function 1: generate_means_sequence
This function:
Calls extract_answers_sequence(collated_answers_path) to obtain answer sequences from multiple respondents;
Computes the mean value for each question, excluding zeros;
Returns a list of 100 mean values.

Strengths：
The logic is straightforward and handles question-wise mean calculation clearly;
Correctly excludes 0 values (e.g., unanswered questions);
The final return format is as expected.

Suggestions and Issues：
1. Unclear usage of extract_answers_sequence
It’s unclear whether extract_answers_sequence supports reading a collated file containing multiple respondents. Typically, it would be used on a per-respondent file.If extract_answers_sequence expects individual files, passing collated_answers.txt may lead to incorrect results.

2. Recommendation: Verify whether extract_answers_sequence can handle merged data. If not, manually split collated_answers.txt using split('\n*\n') and process each block individually.

3. Performance could be optimized
The nested loop (per question × per respondent) works but could be more efficient using NumPy or a vectorized approach.

def generate_means_sequence(collated_answers_path):
    answer_sequences = extract_answers_sequence(collated_answers_path)
    means = []
    for question_index in range(100):
        total = 0
        count = 0
        for sequence in answer_sequences:
            value = sequence[question_index]
            if value != 0:
                total += value
                count += 1
        if count == 0:
            means.append(0.0)
        else:
            means.append(total / count)
    return means


Function 2: visualize_data
Based on the input n:
 n=1: Draws a scatter plot of per-question mean values;
 n=2: Plots each respondent’s answer sequence as a line chart;
 Any other value: Shows an error message via a plot.

Strengths：
 Axis labels and titles are clear;
 Uses alpha transparency to prevent overlapping lines from cluttering the view;
 Error message is shown via a friendly visualization instead of a raw print;
 Axis ticks and limits are thoughtfully set for better readability.
 
Suggestions and Issues：
1. Redundant code：
 Code like x = list(range(1, 101)), plt.xlabel(), etc., is repeated and could be refactored into a shared block.
2. Repeated call to extract_answers_sequence：
 generate_means_sequence calls extract_answers_sequence once; 
 If n == 1, you’re calling it again separately, which causes unnecessary recomputation
Recommendation: Extract data parsing into a shared variable or a helper function to avoid redundancy.

Insufficient validation：
Assumes extract_answers_sequence returns a list of lists;
You should check for:
 Empty or invalid returns;
 Sequences of incorrect length (not 100).
